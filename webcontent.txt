Blue Wave Coin – Ride the Tide of Change 🌊

“Turning compassion into crypto since 2025.”



🌍 About Blue Wave
Blue Wave Coin is the world’s first compassion-backed, community-governed, eco-conscious, socially-equitable digital asset. Our mission is simple:

“Every transaction is a ripple that becomes a wave — a wave of positive change.” Trump Coin and Melania Coin peaked at billions in market cap. Now, we Democrats are answering back with a tsunami of our own, the first-ever Democrat-backed cryptocurrency, Blue Wave Coin: a community-driven, eco-conscious digital asset uniting activists, allies, and everyday Americans to take the fight to Donald Trump’s swamp. This isn’t just a coin. It’s a wave.

With every milestone we hit, we’ll reinvest into the people, animals, and causes that need us most. From sea turtles to safe spaces, no cause is too small or too adorable.

How We Fund the Wave

10% of all coins will be locked and allocated to a secure wallet to fund our milestone initiatives.
As each milestone is reached, we’ll pull funds from this wallet and film & post every project so our community can see that yes, this is really happening.
An additional 10% will be held in a separate wallet dedicated to charities and nonprofits, governed by our DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization).
DAO members will vote on which organizations receive funding — ensuring true community-driven philanthropy.

About Us – The Humans Behind the Wave 🌊

Blue Wave Coin was founded in 2025 by a coalition of marine biologists, slam poets, certified kombucha sommeliers, and one guy who once hugged Jane Fonda at an airport.

We came together with one shared vision: turning compassion into crypto and using blockchain to do things no one asked for but everyone secretly wants.

🌊 Meet the People Powering the Wave

We know transparency matters — that’s why our founders are proud to share their complete bios.

(If you’re reading this on a yacht, please make sure your device is biodegradable.)



🌱 River Moonbeam – Chief Visionary Officer

River’s journey began in a solar-powered treehouse on the Oregon coast. After founding the world’s first gluten-free sandcastle competition, they pivoted to blockchain when they realized smart contracts could help sea turtles schedule therapy sessions.

Fun Fact: River once gave a TED Talk entirely in haiku.
Greatest Achievement: Turning an abandoned shopping cart into a functional hydroponic lettuce farm.
Life Goal: To see dolphins given the right to vote by 2030.


🐢 Coral Sunrise – Director of Aquatic Outreach

Coral has dedicated her life to ocean advocacy — from hand-knitting sweaters for cold penguins to organizing candlelight vigils for misunderstood jellyfish. She holds an honorary degree in Underwater Conflict Resolution from the University of Atlantis.

Fun Fact: Coral can identify over 600 fish by their emotional aura.
Greatest Achievement: Convincing a city council to ban sad-looking aquariums.
Life Goal: To host a global synchronized swimming event in protest of microplastics.


🦉 Sage Evergreen – Head of Sustainable Strategy

Sage is a former urban beekeeper who transitioned into sustainable crypto strategy after realizing honey production could be tokenized. A pioneer in “emotional carbon offsets,” Sage believes love is the most renewable resource.

Fun Fact: Sage refuses to use technology that isn’t powered by compost.
Greatest Achievement: Mediating a dispute between rival farmers’ market hummus vendors.
Life Goal: To replace all golf courses with wildflower meadows by 2040.


🪴 Basil Quantum – Blockchain & Aura Alignment Lead

Basil’s work bridges the gap between cutting-edge blockchain architecture and ancient plant wisdom. When not coding carbon-neutral smart contracts, Basil conducts full-moon cacao ceremonies for stressed-out software engineers.

Fun Fact: Basil once mined an entire Bitcoin using only positive affirmations.
Greatest Achievement: Creating the first NFT series powered exclusively by wind chimes.
Life Goal: To mint a token so sustainable it biodegrades after you spend it.


Do the Founders Get Paid?

Nope.
0% to founders.
Every single Blue Wave Coin is for public distribution, the charity DAO, or funding milestone projects.

Our founders are here for the turtles, the planet, and the vibes — not for Lambos (unless they’re electric, plant-based Lambos).
