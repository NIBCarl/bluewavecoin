CLIENT SAID:
We need to build landing page and presale
Whitepaper is just for the reference to understand the project requirements
I had preferred sample, but it is parody and comedy type - now the client changed the requirement to be serious one, not to be comedy
https://panshibi.com/ 
This was I liked most - but need to make in serious type


For more explanation:
This coin we are trying to launch was to defeat the Trump and Melania (his daughter) coin
"Republicans had Trump Coin and Melania Coin — which peaked in the billions in market cap. Now it’s time for the Democrats to ride their own digital tsunami. This coin should be for Democrats"
So this gonna be Democrats vs Republicans
You know Trump is the lead of Republicans - but our coin launch is just for Democrats
So this web just needs more creative for political things
Kindly read the contents first
Lets do landing page first then, after some fix on there, I will ask you presale too
